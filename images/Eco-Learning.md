- binary search had to be used b/c linear is too slow ... gradually remembered that it exists after thinking for a bit xP
- storing data to be reused in sheet whenever possible, to reduce load on every iteration
- using string functions to remove spaces, capitalization, dashes etc. so strings can be compared w/o annoying the user with >80 options and a clunky UI. back-end shouldn't bother front-end philosophy :).
